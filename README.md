Spring Livelessons code
==================

Hi! If you came to this because you've followed my Spring Livelessons series, then you're in the right place. This project uses Git submodules to link to other projects that I maintain. I used a version of these projects for the videos. The code may have changed some since the videos, but the concepts and code are timeless.
